🌱 Crop Recommendation System
📚 Overview
This project provides a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental factors like temperature, humidity, soil type, rainfall, and NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels. The model helps farmers make data-driven decisions, optimizing agricultural productivity.

🚀 Features
Recommends the best crop based on real-time inputs.

Supports a wide variety of crops.

High accuracy and quick predictions.

Easy-to-use interface (if a frontend is included).

Scalable and customizable for different regions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python - Data analysis and machine learning

Scikit-Learn - Machine learning algorithms

Pandas and NumPy - Data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data visualization

Flask - Web framework for frontend
